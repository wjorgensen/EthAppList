# Feature Plan: Revamp About Page

## Objective

The current "About" page is text-heavy and visually uninteresting. The goal is to redesign the page to be more engaging, modern, and visually appealing, making the information easier to digest for users.

## Technical Design

- **Component-Based Structure**: Break down the page into smaller, reusable React components.
- **Modern UI/UX**:
    - Introduce a dynamic hero section.
    - Use a grid layout with cards and icons to showcase features.
    - Implement a tabbed interface for content sections like "Contribution Guide" and "Code of Conduct" to reduce page length and improve navigation.
- **Styling**: Utilize Tailwind CSS and existing `shadcn/ui` components (`Card`, `Tabs`, `Button`) for a consistent and polished look.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the new design is fully responsive and looks great on all screen sizes.
- **Icons**: Use a library like `lucide-react` (if already in the project, otherwise I'll find an alternative or use SVGs) to add visual cues.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create a new hero section for the About page with a gradient background and engaging title.
- [ ] Redesign the feature list using a grid of cards with icons.
- [ ] Reorganize the "Contribution Guide", "Code of Conduct", and "How Ranking Works" sections into a tabbed interface.
- [ ] Add icons to the project to improve visual communication.
- [ ] Refactor the main `AboutPage` component to assemble the new sections.
- [ ] Ensure the new design is responsive and polished.
- [ ] Remove the now-unused `prose` styling and old layout structure.

## Complexity

Medium. Requires significant changes to the page structure and styling, but mostly involves frontend work.

## Risks

- **Visual Inconsistency**: The new design must align with the existing brand and style of the application. I will use the existing color palette and component styles to mitigate this.
- **Component Availability**: I will need to check if an icon library is available or if I need to add one.
